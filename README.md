This repository is the collection of SQL Database conncetivity with JAVA that has been done at college as well as the collection of the program that were done while solving the Challenges given by the Professor.

This repo has divided into two main categories:-<br>

1. <u>Learning Programs</u>:- This section contains all the programs that contain java codes with sql queries.<br>

2. <u>Challenges</u>:- This section contains the Challenging programs.<br>

# Resources Required!

<br><b>
JDBC is Java Database Connectivity and for connecting Database with Java we required some applications which are:-<br>

1. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/04lg1WT.png" height=28px style="transform :translateY(5px);"> **[Xampp_Server](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)** For creating your Database locally with the localhost phpmyadmin you need to install xampp server.<br>

2. <img src="https://i.imgur.com/pFjfNTq.png" height=35px style="transform :translateY(5px);">**[mysql_connector_jar](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)** For connecting your java codes with your local Database you need my sql connector jar file.<br>
